stroller

A small GPS tracker for things like phones. Displays current location,
ground speed, altitude etc, along with a track of where the device has
been since the app started running.

Should work whenever a GPS device is present and usable by Qt Mobility.

This is a Qt/QML program, hence you build it thus:

  qmake stroller.pro   # or qmake-qt stroller.pro
  make

it is safe to build with QtCreator. You want cmake? Go ahead, do it yourself.

There is a completely unrealistic way of making test data in the
progral spiral.c, which can be compiled by using

gcc spiral.c -lm -o spiral

the only advantage of the spiral data is that they excercise the 
map drawing and scaling code.
